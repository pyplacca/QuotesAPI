# Quotes API

A simple a RESTful API built with Flask. This api was built for learning sake.

The quotes provided by this api were originally sourced from a resource I can't remember. Either way, all credits to the provider.

## API url
https://.../popular-quotes/

## Making get requests
You can basically visit the url above to get a random quote or optionally enter `https://.../popular-quotes/<id>` in the address bar to get a quote with a specific id.

Enter `https://.../popular-quotes/all` to get all available quotes

All valid responses returned are in a json format
